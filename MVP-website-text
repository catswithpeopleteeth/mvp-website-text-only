“MVP Has been our go-to partner for website design for the last five years. MVP was the first firm we called when we decided to do a complete overhaul of our site. After speaking with MVP, it was clear they understood and could execute on our requirements. Our newest and second consecutive MVP website redesign demonstrates their deep knowledge and understanding of private equity industry communications our business and marketing requirements, and their commitment to form follows function approach, which is far superior to the many template-based, and quite frankly vulnerable, solutions we saw from other agencies.”
David Schnadig, Managing Partner

Photography and Videography
Show More. Say Less.
Consider original photography (on-site, studio, table-top, etc.) and videography (live action or motion graphics) for both your website and digital marketing communications. With creative work for multiple divisions of 3M ranging from Consumer to Healthcare, and from Software to Industrial markets, we invite you to view samples for such Private Equity and M&A firms as Shoreline Equity Partners, Cortec Group, and Clearsight Advisors; Medical Research Organization NAMSA; EdTech Achieve3000, and Industrial Component Manufacturer IDC, among others. And our latest CEO testimonial videos for private equity firm, Mason Wells, reflects the latest trends in capturing portfolio company case history success stories.
We have the tools and talent to make your processes, products, people and spaces radiate their best, and we’re confident that you’ll see what an important asset these authentic visuals can be. For example, images of your staff are going to be more compelling than stock photography and will genuinely express your brand.
Our experts will partner with your team to create unforgettable imagery. From Food to Financial and from Manufacturing to Healthcare, B2B or B2C… Go MVP for lights, camera, action!
Remote Video Testimonial Capabilities: Given the ever-changing remote work environment, MVP is the premier provider of remote videography for Private Equity and M&A firms, as well as other businesses, seeking high-quality remote CEO, Board Member/Advisor, and Founder testimonials. Rather than rely on the lower quality video recording capabilities of Zoom and Microsoft Teams, MVP provides a full kit of remote video and voice recording equipment to ensure that interviewees look and sound their best, as if they were in an on-location shoot.
MVP utilizes its extensive knowledge of the private capital industry, as well as each firm’s investment and exit thesis, to develop custom-tailored interview questions that elicit key points from each respondent. After the recording, interviewees simply repack the equipment, attach a prepaid shipping label, and send the equipment back to MVP for processing and post-production. MVP then creates impactful testimonial videos and informational case studies that can be uploaded to client websites and/or data rooms individually or integrated with on-location B-roll as evidenced by our latest work for Chicago-based Svoboda Capital.
Compared with on-location productions and associated crew expenses, MVP’s Remote Video Testimonials are a budget-friendly way to record professional interview videos with colleagues, partners, and business associates whether around the corner or around the world. This exciting new technology allows companies to produce fresh video content –– through COVID times and beyond!

MVP Welcomed to WordPress VIP Agency Partner Program
By MVP Marketing + Design | June 2, 2021
We are pleased to announce that Automattic, WordPress’s parent company, has designated MVP Marketing + Design a WordPress VIP Silver Agency Partner. This recognition is indicative of the advanced website design and development capabilities that MVP has showcased through numerous Private Capital and Enterprise-class websites on behalf of such clients as Roadtrek, NAMSA, United States Law Firm Group, AdvantageData, Rotary Systems and more.
Admittance into the WordPress VIP Silver Agency Partner program means that Automattic recognizes MVP’s ability to provide Enterprise level website design and development services to large-scale multisite engagements, including deployment of WooCommerce E-comm software, on WordPress’s Cloud tier hosting platform. Representative WordPress VIP websites include such companies as USA Today Sports, Capgemini, The New York Post, iOne Digital, The Kaiser Family Foundation and other top brands. According to Automattic, these organizations and other top brands utilize “a best-in-class cloud platform and receive expert guidance and hands-on support from a partner network consisting of the best WordPress design and development shops on the planet.” Of note, MVP is now one of 35 other US digital agencies that have earned such Agency Partner recognition—and  is the only one focusing extensively on the Private Equity, Investment Banking, Sub-debt and RIA markets.
Said, Dick Weinrib, MVP’s President & CEO, “We appreciate that Automattic (WordPress) has acknowledged our more than 20 years of award-winning WordPress website design and development experience for leaders in such verticals as Private Capital, Financial, Healthcare, Technology-Enabled Products and Services, as well as B2B and B2C Manufacturing. Our “Best of the Midwest” team looks forward to partnering with WordPress VIP to offer our brand-to-web design, development and E-Commerce services to companies seeking a Most Valuable Partner for integrated digital marketing, design and Cloud-based  website hosting support.”

Mason Wells:
New Private Equity Site Focuses on Putting People First
PROJECT CHALLENGE
Mason Wells is a Milwaukee-based private equity firm that has raised $2.4 billion in aggregate across five independent buyout funds. The firm partners with the founders, families, and managers of primarily Midwestern US-based businesses to help them realize their financial potential while preserving the company’s legacy. Mason Wells’ longstanding approach to private equity revolves around the investment it makes in people, the enduring partnerships it builds with management teams, and the deep network of industry resources it provides. The Mason Wells website, which MVP originally designed in 2016, along with updating the firm’s corporate identity, was holding its own but in light of the surge in new private equity websites post-pandemic, the managing partners sought to upgrade the site’s form and functionality to be as good, if not better, than the competition. Given MVP’s longstanding Most Valuable Partner relationship with the firm, which has included providing website hosting, maintenance and security since the former site’s launch, Mason Wells turned to MVP for a new and vibrant website overhaul.
PROJECT SOLUTION
Mason Wells is committed to “creating enduring value by putting people first for over 25 years.” To fulfill business, marketing and design objectives, MVP responded with a homepage Milwaukee flyover video that uses portco team imagery to demonstrate that this private equity firm does “not just buy businesses but invests in people.” Distinctively departing from its competitors, the site utilizes a full-screen approach with plenty of white space to showcase key content, e.g., dynamic deal statistics, portfolio company success stories and latest news. A new and more interactive hamburger-style menu simplifies navigation and prompts visitors to check out investment criteria (by Investment parameters for platform and tuck-in acquisitions), portfolio companies (by sector, fund and those seeking add-on acquisitions), news and contact, as well as a CTA to download the MVP-redesigned Summary Overview PDF. Further, to add impact to the Strategy section, an interactive map not only enables visitors to view the disposition of Mason Wells’ investments but to examine a camo portco overview with more detailed company information.
While the site has many new and innovative form and functionality features, including active content, accordion blocks, and hover reveals, MVP notably produced 11 CEO testimonial videos that enliven each of their respective case histories. While attending the client’s annual portfolio company meeting, MVP interviewed and videoed each of Mason Wells’ “portco-pros,” who recounted the specialized tools and techniques they used to realize their own custom-tailored value creation plans (VCPs) to achieve their respective—and often astounding—exit value multiples. Following the shoot, MVP added post-production effects including sound, titles, animated graphics, and charts to help each of the CEO stories resonate with the “Proven. Disciplined and Forthright Approach,” that has characterized Mason Wells’ “Private Equity, Midwest Integrity” appeal to business owners, executive operating partners and intermediaries for over 25 years.

“Fantastic. Looks great. Big day for the firm. Thank you again for all the work from the MVP team.”

RA Capital:
Hooray for RA Capital: A New Investment Bank Website Built for Private Companies
PROJECT CHALLENGE
RA Capital Advisors, based in San Diego, California, is a boutique investment bank that specializes in mergers and acquisitions and raising institutional capital for privately held companies. They represent clients in sell-side M&A transactions across a wide range of industries in the lower middle-market (deal values ranging from $10M – $500M). In an effort to revitalize their website, which had become dated and did not accurately reflect the premium quality image the firm desired, RA Capital sought the help of MVP Marketing + Design to create a distinctive and easy-to-manage website that would support their sales and marketing objectives.
Given that the website played a crucial “middle of the funnel” role in RA Capital’s sales process, it was vital that the site convey a user experience that was on par with speaking to the firm directly. Among the challenges faced during website development, RA Capital requested that MVP convey their value proposition in a more concise manner and improve the functionality to enable team members to easily publish webinars (video) on the frontend, while also supporting transactions, team bios, client stories, and news and insights on the backend.
PROJECT SOLUTION
To tackle this project, MVP collaborated closely with the RA Capital team to understand their brand vision and the specific needs of their clients, which included both referral sources and potential clients, primarily private and family-owned businesses. MVP utilized its five-phase MVP TeamMate℠ process to articulate the firm’s business, marketing, competitive, and creative requirements, including website form and functionality. The approach, which is derived from the waterfall method of software engineering, clearly outlines key requirements such as budget, timeline, content, roles, and responsibilities.
Once the website wireframes and underlying site content were agreed upon, which included a prominent role for video and client testimonials, MVP’s award-winning investment banking and private equity website designers leveraged the client’s logo to create an “R”-shaped graphic container that uniquely frames the home page imagery showcasing conference room “deal candy.” Additionally, they incorporated a vibrant diagonal stroke that changes color and activates content on mouse-over.
Similar techniques were used to animate other content, including type, images, and text, to guide viewers on an interactive journey through various site sections such as transactions, client stories, and news. The overall design features “bathed-in-blue” visuals that reflect RA Capital’s San Diego beachside location, along with a “less is more” navigation approach, ample “white” space, and original video and photography. Together, these elements effectively convey that RA Capital is the “right type of investment banking firm with the right type of experience” for their unique and demanding audience of private companies.

Sounds of Success for New Nashville-Based Investment Banking Website
PROJECT CHALLENGE
Based just outside Music City USA, aka Nashville, Tennessee, BCA provides world-class investment banking and M&A advisory to healthcare services, healthcare technology and business services companies. The premier independent investment bank approaches every project uniquely with guidance tailored to each individual client. Seeking a complete revamp of their earlier site, BCA turned to MVP for an investment bank website design that would be expansive, impressive and one of a kind to match the breadth and depth of their expertise.
PROJECT SOLUTION
The right messaging is important but imagery can speak volumes. The new home and supporting page designs magnify the power of first impressions with a combination of dynamic deal statistics, Nashville flyover drone footage and Athens of the South visuals to be awed.
MVP built the site to function as flawlessly as it looks. The MVP TeamMate℠ custom design and development process makes the site more interactive and targeted to each user. For example, filters for “service type” and “sector” enable visitors to see exactly what they are looking for on BCA’s robust transactions page, which features MVP’s easy to use tombstone maker in place of time consuming and cumbersome Photoshop methods.
When designing a site, access and ease of use are paramount. Responsiveness is a given, but MVP also builds browser compatibility into every website it designs and BCA’s site is no exception. Going above and beyond template even WordPress theme designs, MVP’s dedicated Team and News pages and a comprehensive action oriented menu mean that visitors can get the content they need faster, thanks to improved user experience (UX) design.
Updates can’t be an afterthought. The new site is built on MVP’s customized WordPress platform that allows BCA employees to add and remove content and even create whole new sections with minimal training. The new site’s elegant design and MVP-enhanced CMS will keep pace with BCA’s growth trajectory for years to come. And that sure sounds sweet to these healthcare investment banking and M&A professionals.
CLIENT TAKE
“Our new website highlights our expertise in mergers and acquisitions and showcases the team, our focus, and our experience in a way that resonates with viewers.  The MVP team was fantastic throughout the redesign process, and the resulting website has been a homerun!”

Teksetra:
New Branding, Name and E-Comm Website Help Single Source Technology Provider Go to the Future—and Beyond!
Project Challenge
Teksetra, formerly BLM Technologies, is a national provider of single source technology solutions serving financial institutions, governmental agencies, healthcare organizations, educational institutions, retail franchises, hospitality services—and more. Faced with the challenge of generating new business in uncertain times, BLM sought to jumpstart opportunities through a bold new e-Commerce website in place of an earlier “call for quote” approach. Seizing on the opportunity go the extra mile, the company chose to simultaneously reinvent its brand and rename itself in the process. The Client turned to MVP for a holistic solution that would integrate all brand-to-web components in a way that would give new life to the organization’s mission: To be the nationally trusted, single source, comprehensive business technology support, service, and hardware provider.
Project Solution
MVP’s first step entailed applying its MVP BrandMate℠ process, which included extensive internal and external stakeholder interviews, to generate business and brand positioning statements and subsequently visual imagery that would reflect the company’s capability to provide end-to-end technology solutions that “maximize uptime and minimize downtime.” Once verbal messaging was approved, the client asked MVP to generate a new company name that would signify that Teksetra engineers custom technology solutions that help enterprises succeed, grow, and serve the needs of the remote workforce. And also meet technology and automation challenges by providing comprehensive IT lifecycle solutions in payment and transaction, imaging, digital signage, onsite repairs, maintenance repair center service, IT outsourcing, and more.
Utilizing its proven MVP NameMate℠ process, MVP ideated over 500 unique corporate names and researched and validated them through a combination of client and customer feedback as well as preliminary trademark and URL search availability.  The MVP-proposed name “Teksetra” was forged to signify the company’s ever-growing commitment to serving new customers while expanding its full range of products, services, technologies and markets. The new tagline “Trusted. Flexible. Responsive.” embodies the client’s commitment to not only serving new E-comm customers but those who have relied previously on Teksetra’s stellar customer service and sales team for velvet glove support.
Complementing the rebranding initiative, and following the award-winning MVP TeamMate℠ website design and development process, the new custom-tailored WordPress Woo eCommerce website features many new capabilities, services and learning resources and will soon integrate with the client’s ERP system.
The extensive rebranding, naming, website design and development and marcom project features:
A new and modern corporate name, logo, and tagline reflecting Teksetra’s continuous growth and evolution
New brand standards featuring vibrant imagery, colors and typography that subtly reinforce the company’s legacy while embracing a sleek modern look that can be easily applied to all online and off-line marketing communications assets
Intuitive website navigation and expanded resources that create a user-friendly environment that streamlines customer service capabilities
Comprehensive eCommerce functionality that expands order processing capabilities and creates an efficient new way for customers to order online and ultimately integrate with the company’s ERP system
Highly customized MVP WordPress CMS site administration that enables marketers to add and remove content, install plug-ins and even create whole new sections with minimal training
Dynamic Brand Reveal Video created in-house and designed by MVP to motivate Teksetra’s customers into learning more about the reason for the name change and the company’s single-source technology provider brand value position; please click here to view the video
Teksetra’s new brand name, E-Comm website and marketing communications system will be sure to keep pace with its mission of being the leading single-source IT technology solutions provider today, tomorrow—and beyond!
CLIENT TAKE
“The launch of our new eCommerce website is an exciting day for all of us! The brand revitalization that MVP helped us achieve, reflects our passion for innovation and provides the opportunity to introduce exciting new capabilities, services, and solutions as well as enhance our existing offerings. We truly appreciate all of your team’s hard work in helping us finally get to this point!”

NAMSA:
New Custom Website for a Medical Device-Focused CRO on the Go!
PROJECT CHALLENGE
As the world’s only 100% medical device-focused Contract Research Organization (CRO), MVP’s relationship with NAMSA began in 2017 when, after a successful SEO engagement, NAMSA asked MVP to resolve design and functionality issues vexing their previous website.
Based on the success of that effort, which included UX improvements, revamping code for faster load time and configuration of a “NAMSA Test Navigator,” a web tool that provides visibility into the breadth and depth of NAMSA’s medical device testing capabilities, the client entrusted MVP to build an entirely new custom CMS website from scratch. Key requirements encompassed a modern, user-friendly experience capable of delivering extensive educational resources and development insights to facilitate accelerated commercialization of life-saving medical device technologies.
PROJECT SOLUTION
Striving to leapfrog their earlier efforts, MVP’s design and development team undertook a fresh MVP TeamMate℠ needs analysis, which not only identified buyer and user personas but surveyed competitors’ websites US and worldwide. Of note, subsequent to the earlier corporate website reset, NAMSA tapped MVP to create four new custom sites for their operations in France, Germany, Japan and China. (Collectively, they offered medical device professionals better navigation, user-experience, control panel options, advanced filtering, and SEO improvements, many of which were incorporated into the new website along with GDPR compliance.)
Following research, MVP delivered extensive site wireframes, design concepts and a content strategy showcasing the client’s rich history and deep-rooted expertise in providing Sponsors with proven solutions critical to proactive management of global development requirements. Enhancements feature an MVP-produced home page and customer testimonial videos as well as customized symbols, icons, and graphic assets that were designed in synch with corporate brand standards. The site’s clean layout and streamlined navigation reduce clutter while CTAs direct visitors to such functional enrichments as the NAMSA Test Navigator, an e-Comm based Course Catalog and on-demand webinars. Seamless performance on all mobile devices was mandatory. An exceptionally easy-to-use WordPress CMS backend admin tool, which MVP modified to meet NAMSA’s unique requirements, supplemental MVP SearchMate℠ SEO best practices, and an MVP-managed services website hosting, maintenance and security program combine to make NAMSA the CRO that’s not only ready to go – but grow!
CLIENT TAKE
“MVP’s work consistently surpassed our expectations. Their superb execution of website design, development, branding services, and digital communications, combined with their thorough understanding of our business needs, allowed us to focus our in-depth therapeutic knowledge toward our commitment to bringing life-enhancing technologies to the marketplace in a safe, efficacious manner. The entire team was a pleasure to work with and they not only fulfilled our deliverables but went the extra mile in many areas. I recommend MVP to any medical device manufacturer or healthcare organization seeking a “most valuable partner” in website design, development and digital marketing.”

Mortar Group:
New Branding & Website Redesign Place New York Real Estate Fund at the Intersection of Architecture, Development and Asset Management
PROJECT CHALLENGE
Based in Manhattan, and positioned to serve investors seeking above average risk-adjusted returns, Mortar’s mission is to bring responsible real estate investment to New York City and the surrounding region by binding architecture, development and asset management into a single practice.
Having raised over $47 million in equity, with over $239 million in sales, Mortar has designed and built notable new multifamily residential buildings and private residences, and has also converted and renovated existing buildings in niche New York neighborhoods, including Brooklyn and Queens. The firm emphasizes maximizing investor returns and minimizing risk while providing residents with the highest standard of urban living and its projects have been featured in such publications as the New York Times, Fortune, Globe St.com, Inc. and others.
Given an earlier lackluster website that came up short on eye-catching visual imagery and distinguishing verbal messaging, Mortar tapped Minneapolis-based MVP, a leader in private equity firm website redesign, for a combination of rebranding and website redesign that would successfully communicate the firm’s unrivaled track record of real estate investment since 2001, which includes 30 projects since November 2021, and consistent return on real estate investment in prime New York neighborhoods.
PROJECT SOLUTION
MVP initiated the client’s project though its proven MVP BrandMate℠ process, which incorporates competitive website research and brand messaging analysis and formulation. Equally important, MVP interviewed 10 key stakeholders both inside and outside of the company. Following the interviews, MVP collaborated with the Mortar team to formulate a series of real estate investment fund business and brand positioning statements that position Mortar as the multi-family real estate investment fund that “binds architecture, development and asset management into a single practice focused on multifamily real estate investments in niche New York neighborhoods.”
Based on that branding foundation, MVP’s website design team, following a review of competitive real estate fund websites, formulated the “look and feel” of a new and impressive website that would differentiate Mortar from other multifamily real estate fund websites in New York and across the country.
The new MVP-designed home page grabs viewer attention through use of evocative drone fly-over footage dramatically featuring the Manhattan skyline, the adjacent boroughs and several Mortar multifamily residential projects.
The site also employs MVP’s unique application of the WordPress back-end site administration tool, which enables Mortar’s marketing team to make website content updates and site administration in a New York minute.
This new and distinctive real estate fund website, in combination with MVP-crafted brand messaging, site copy, and supplemental MVP search engine optimization (SEO) support, has awakened investor interest in an investment management fund that has yielded integrated and secure multi-family real estate investment opportunities in the prime niche neighborhoods of the city that never sleeps.
CLIENT TAKE
“Although they’re about 1,200 miles west of us, MVP built us a great website that more than meets our expectations. We researched and interviewed many other New York based website design and branding firms, and we chose to work with MVP. Now that they’ve completed our site (on time and on budget), we’re looking forward to the next phase of our project through additional projects such as content development, investor and how-to videos, PPC advertising, SEO and more. The process with MVP exceeded our expectations.”

North Star Resource Group:
New Financial Services Website Positioned for Growth
PROJECT CHALLENGE
Insuring against adversity, investing for opportunity, and planning for both is the mission of the North Star Resource Group. With $10 BN of assets under management, $5.8 million donated to charity, 113 years of service and over 140,000 clients nationwide, this independent financial services company required a new and vibrant site to help individuals and families start and stay the path to financial security. The Registered Investor Advisory firm (RIA) required a new and highly interactive site that would improve functionality, support its team of more than 180 advisors in 50 states, and communicate its commitment to client financial wellness.
PROJECT SOLUTION
One of the main tasks facing MVP was to create a user-friendly tool for visitors to match with an Advisor based on key criteria such as location, income, occupation, age, and financial goals. MVP also spent considerable time in crafting an advisor-friendly UX that would encourage individual registered investment advisors to join North Star in a joint effort to build a practice optimized for growth and independence with all the advantages of practice ownership. A full range of support services backed by testimonials of others who’ve made the move are incorporated into the site design. To accommodate the many and varied financial services offered by the firm, MVP designed an extensive mega menu featuring a clear and concise pathway to 16 practice areas grouped into two main buckets, Insurance & Investments and Life Events Planning. Compound filters for News & Events and Resources, the latter of which includes five MVP-designed business calculators enhances the site’s functionality as well as its form. The bright and colorful site complemented by extensive editorial and company photography is a sight to behold. Whether clients are seeking a financial professional, or such products as financial planning, investments, life or disability insurance, North Star’s new MVP-designed, custom-tailored and easy to administer WordPress site will point them in the right direction.
CLIENT TAKE
“Partnering with MVP to redesign our website was one of the best decisions we could have made. After vetting numerous other website design companies, MVP stood out not only with their outstanding design work, but also their team’s dedication to customer service and project management. The entire team, consisting of Ben in project management, Paul and Xiaohan in design, and Jeff in development worked together to take our ideas and goals and delivered a website that worked flawlessly for our audiences. We are loving our new website! We look forward to working with the MVP team in the future.“

ShoreLine Equity Partners:
New Florida-based Private Equity Website Makes Waves
PROJECT CHALLENGE
Based in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida, ShoreLine Equity Partners is a private equity firm focused on investing in lower middle market companies. With over $1.2 billion in historic transaction value and $300M in committed capital, this leading Southeast PE firm’s model is to follow a “win-win” value proposition for shareholders, employees, customers, vendors, and the communities within which its companies operate. ShoreLine needed a self-managing website that would serve as a first and lasting introduction to visitors through use of distinctive imagery and flawless functionality that would deliver a great experience and spark further interaction and deal flow.
PROJECT SOLUTION
The new custom-tailored website’s enticing beachfront imagery strikes a balance between impressive and inviting. MVP designed a homepage that immediately sends visitors on the right path to learning more about ShoreLine with buttons that call out “Who we are,” “Why we are different” and “Play Video.” A customized and intuitive menu helps visitors navigate the site’s rich waters. These interior site pages boast photos that speak to the many sides of ShoreLine’s business. They are all unified with a soft blue gradient that matches the ShoreLine Equity Partners logo. The site also employs MVP’s unique application of the WordPress backend site administration tool, making timely content updates as easy as a day at the beach for ShoreLine’s marketing team.
MVP, in combination with its local partner 3D Digital, provided a joint combination of team member photography and videography featuring spontaneous team member interaction and heartfelt interviews conducted by MVP with ShoreLine’s portfolio company CEOs. These elements enable this leading Florida-based private equity firm to stand out regionally and nationally in a sea of more mundane private equity websites.
CLIENT TAKE
“I just wanted to say thanks from the Shoreline Team for all the work on creating a great website. I know COVID-19 made this a longer project than normal but we are very pleased with the outcome. We have had a lot of good feedback on the website. Thank you very much!”

Clearsight Advisors:
World Class Investment Banking with a Site to Match
PROJECT CHALLENGE
Headquartered in Washington, DC, Clearsight Advisors is a leading investment bank focused on business and technology-enabled services. The rising company’s footprint now includes New York and Dallas offices as it serves clients worldwide.
With an impressive market position serving entrepreneurs, private equity firms, boards of directors and institutional investors, the firm wanted a site that was both expansive and personable. Clearsight puts people first and has generated enormous success through focusing on collaboration. It was up to MVP to capture the Clearsight culture through cohesive branding, logo design, team photography and video, website design and development.
PROJECT SOLUTION
MVP initiated the project with a combination of competitive brand and website research, message refinement and ultimately a new and inventive corporate identity.
Next it was on to onsite team photography and video that is incorporated throughout the site. Seeing the people who constitute Clearsight engages visitors immediately and showcases the group from many angles. When visitors move to the team page, they are invited to see what drives these personalities. Each team member transforms with a hover over the professional portrait. A chef, a sports fan, a gymnast—and a World Series of Poker playing Managing Partner—round out the entourage and both entertains and helps visitors get to know the lighter side of these hard working M&A professionals.
Inspiring design, improved navigation and multi-level filtering means every visitor experience is perfect. As part of a comprehensive brand exploration, the new Clearsight logo is professional, contemporary, and innovative. As a full-service digital agency, MVP is also hosting the Clearsight website, ensuring flawless functionality for a site that is clearly a cut above the rest.

Roadtrek:
On the Road Again with the “Leader in Class B Motorhomes”
Project Challenge
Roadtrek is a leading North American manufacturer of Class B Motorhomes, selling its camper vans through a network of independent RV dealers in the USA and Canada. Today, a portfolio company of Groupe Rapido (France), and headquartered in Cambridge, ON, Roadtrek challenged MVP to refresh its site with an emphasis on the product development, technological advancements, European styling and business process features reflective of this family-owned group’s constant focus on customer satisfaction, quality and attention to detail.
Project Solution
Building on MVP’s website design and development engagements for Roadtrek’s previous parent companies, including private equity firm Industrial Opportunity Partners (Evanston, IL) and the Erwin Hymer Group (Bad Waldsee, Germany), MVP’s web designers and developers not only revamped the site’s “look and feel” but advanced their earlier “Build Your Own” Roadtrek tool featuring a 22-variable price and styling configurator as well as Find a Local Dealer functionality, a US/Canadian currency converter, roadside assistance resources and RV lifestyle and social media enhancements. The newly relaunched site complements Roadtrek’s luxury motor branding while showcasing MVP’s prowess in up-scale consumer durables website design and development.
CLIENT TAKE
“MVP did an outstanding job in redesigning our website, providing lead-generating SEO, and helping us increase sales and profits pre-and post-sale. They’ve been a Most Valuable Partner to the Roadtrek brand since they undertook our site redesign in 2016 and continue to serve us today under our new parent company Groupe Rapido.”

Origami Capital Partners:
Chicago Private Equity Firm Website Unfolds with Added Branding and Digital Marketing Assets
PROJECT CHALLENGE
Origami Capital Partners provides flexible capital across the world from their headquarters in Chicago, Illinois. They manage over $950 million of committed institutional capital and specialize in solving complex challenges to unlock value in assets. Origami sought a reimagined digital presence that would visually and verbally convey their impressive market position.
PROJECT SOLUTION
To unlock the complex world of the firm’s globally recognized secondary market niche, Origami and MVP crafted language and branding elements that defined their company both for internal and client-facing communications. With new outward facing business positioning statements and inward facing brand positioning terminology in hand gleaned from extensive VOC stakeholder interviews, MVP helped write copy for a reimagined website.
The solutions and leadership Origami provides are complex, so MVP designed the “look and feel” of the new site to be simple yet elegant. The improved navigation is intuitive for a range of visitors, so counterparties can find exactly what they need — and quickly.
The website is responsive across varying screen sizes and Origami can easily update pages and create whole new sections through the MVP TeamMate℠ enhanced WordPress Content Management System (CMS). Providing managed services to optimize site performance post launch, website hosting and security were the last pieces of the puzzle to fall into place for one new private equity website that will perform as well as it looks.
CLIENT TAKE
“It was a pleasure to work with you guys. Our team is tremendously excited about the launch and we believe this is a huge step forward towards the future continued growth of Origami. Thanks again for all your work. I truly appreciate the responsiveness, particularly towards the end as I know my requests were numerous! I would be delighted to serve as a reference in the future.  When it comes to finding a “most valuable” private equity website design and development partner, you guys proved to be the perfect fit!”

The firm is uniquely positioned as true operators who have experience working in and managing businesses that range from the LMM to the Fortune 500.
Founded by John Stewart, Lauren Mulholland and Scot Duncan, the firm believes that there is a “middle ground” in every situation where everyone wins. John is a fisherman, who has explored the Florida Middle Grounds, a collection of natural reefs 99 miles NNW of Tampa Bay, Florida, which is accessible to only the most dedicated enthusiasts. A bounty in the form of a plentiful catch rewards those daring enough to make the trip. Likewise, MiddleGround challenged MVP to create a bold new site whose UX, website design and content structure would convey the firm’s unique hands-on approach, in-house operational expertise and friendly hard-working team.
PROJECT SOLUTION
Immersing itself in the world of the industry captains with whom it seeks to sail, the website opens with the firm’s brand essence: “Experienced Operators Investing in the Middle Market” and a captivating factory floor walk-through video that beckons the visitor to explore. For those who want to dive deeper, a fact sheet is immediately on deck.
MVP’s user experience architects and web designers optimized navigation so that site visitors can visit related sections based on their individual needs, e.g., as a business owner, limited partner, or aspiring team member. The home page itself is effectively a one-page-wonder that entices the visitor to learn more about the company’s Approach, Investment Focus, Testimonials, Team and Portfolio through clear, concise and image rich calls-to-action.
Original iconography and carefully selected imagery serve to engage viewers and ultimately lead them to the firm’s expanding portfolio, which may be filtered by investors seeking add-ons. Likewise, news and blog can be sorted by category and/or keyword search.
Notably, the inviting and distinctive Team section not only provides bios but is supplemented by V-cards, LinkedIn access and portfolio company affiliation. To add additional interest the MiddleGround crew is energized by University of Kentucky Wildcat imagery, which reflects the firm’s hometown roots and team-friendly, win-win attitude.
The entire site is dynamically responsive and optimally resizes for either desktop or mobile interfaces.
The Catch: MVP’s MiddleGround website launch enables these “Main Street to Wall Street” wildcats to reach the high ground when it comes to differentiating their PE firm from others while keeping their catches fresh through custom back-end admin tools that allow them to dynamically update site content and add whole new sections without the need for either programming knowledge or outside support. Bon voyage!
Client Take
“The new website looks great! It was a pleasure working with the whole team at MVP. I see this as the beginning of an ongoing relationship.”

2023’s Top 10 Trends for Effective Private Equity & Investment Bank Website Design
By MVP Marketing + Design | January 31, 2023
A private equity, mezzanine capital or M&A firm’s website plays a critical role in its success. It serves as a platform to effectively communicate the firm’s story, reinforce its brand, and attract new business opportunities.
Take inspiration from these recently launched and award-winning MVP private capital websites when revamping or creating your own. These current examples, including private equity firm Mason Wells, real estate investment fund Mortar and such M&A firms and I-banks as RA Capital, RL Hulett and Brentwood Capital, showcase crucial design elements such as investment portfolios, team profiles, and investment criteria and reflect the latest trends in private equity website design.
As we look ahead to 2023, here are our top 10 private capital web design tips for excellent user experiences:
Minimalism – Clean and simple design with minimal graphics and use of white space to create a professional look.
Responsiveness – Websites that are optimized for viewing on multiple devices including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.
Bold typography – The use of large and bold fonts to create a strong visual impact and communicate the company’s brand message.
Interactive elements – Incorporating interactive elements such as hover effects, animations including dynamic deal stats, and micro-interactions to make the website more engaging.
Video background – The use of full-screen video background to create a visually impactful and memorable first impression. CEO video testimonials and sector video case histories are increasingly prevalent. See this link to Mason Wells’ site in particular.
Portfolios or Investments – Showcasing past and current portfolio holdings or investments in a visually appealing way to give potential investors an understanding of the company’s expertise and track record.
Transparency – Providing clear and detailed information about the company, its investment strategies such as ESG, and team to build trust and credibility with potential investors.
User-friendly navigation – A simple and intuitive navigation structure that makes it easy for users to find the information they are looking for.
Accessibility – Providing inclusive web design by ensuring the website is accessible to users with disabilities and adhering to necessary accessibility standards. Private Capital is paying increasing attention to ADA compliance, as demonstrated by MVP’s website for community reinvestment fund CRF USA.
Cybersecurity – Implementing robust cybersecurity measures to ensure the website and its user’s data is protected from cyber-attacks. This is a function of not only minimizing the use of third-party developer plugins but utilizing SSL certificates and dedicated or virtual dedicated web servers to double down on security. Note: all MVP sites utilize these features.
These trends reflect the growing importance of creating a professional, user-friendly, and visually appealing online presence for private capital firms. Whether private equity firm, real estate finance, junior capital, sub-debt or venture capital firm, incorporating these current trends means being better able showcase your organization’s expertise and attract potential investors.

Hooray for RA Capital: A New Investment Bank Website Built for Private Companies
By MVP Marketing + Design | January 25, 2023
Minneapolis, January 25, 2023 – MVP Marketing + Design, a Minneapolis-based Website Design, Branding and Digital Agency, is excited to announce the launch of a new M&A website for RA Capital, a premier investment bank based in San Diego, California focused on serving the unique needs of private and family-owned businesses. The website, which was developed in close partnership with the RA Capital team, aims to provide clients and referral sources with a premium user experience that accurately reflects the firm’s brand image and value proposition.
“The site [looks] very good and [is] something we can all be proud of,” stated Eliot Peters, Managing Partner of RA Capital Advisors. Said Dick Weinrib, MVP’s President and CEO, “We are thrilled to unveil RA Capital’s new website, which we believe will be a game-changer for their clients and referral sources. Their previous website had become dated and did not accurately reflect the premium quality image they desired for their firm. Thanks to MVP’s “Best of the Midwest” team of website designers, developers and project managers, we were able to create a website that not only looks great but also effectively conveys our client’s value proposition and experience to their audience of private companies.”
The new website, which plays a crucial “middle of the funnel” role in RA Capital’s sales process, includes a variety of features that will enhance the user experience. The site includes improved functionality that enables team members to easily publish webinars and other video content, as well as transactions, team bios, client stories, and news and insights. The site also includes an “R”-shaped graphic container that frames the home page imagery and unique animations that activate content on mouse-over.
MVP collaborated closely with RA Capital Advisors to understand their brand vision and the specific needs of their clients. The MVP TeamMate℠ process, which is derived from the waterfall method of software engineering, was used to articulate the firm’s business, marketing, competitive, and creative requirements, including website form and functionality.
“We are proud to have partnered with RA Capital Advisors on this project,” added Weinrib. “Their team had a clear vision for what they wanted to achieve with their website, and our team was able to bring that vision to life. We believe the new website will be a valuable tool for RA Capital Advisors in their ongoing efforts to connect with their target audience of private and family-owned businesses.”
The new website can be viewed at www.raca.com. RA Capital Advisors is a boutique investment bank that specializes in mergers and acquisitions and raising institutional capital for privately held companies. They represent clients in sell-side M&A transactions across a wide range of industries in the lower middle-market (deal values ranging from $10M – $500M). RA Capital Advisors invites everyone to visit their new website and experience the improvements and new features.

New TEAM Industries Drivetrain Engineering Website Takes to the Road with MVP
By MVP Marketing + Design | January 10, 2023
Minneapolis, January 10, 2023 – MVP Marketing + Design, a Minneapolis-based Website Design, Branding and Digital Agency, is pleased to announce the launch of a new website for TEAM Industries, a leading drivetrain engineering and manufacturing company based in Bagley, Minnesota.
Founded in 1967, TEAM Industries focuses on drivetrain technologies and serves the recreational vehicle, off-road, agricultural, and turf care markets. With over 1,200 employees and eight facilities totaling over one million square feet of manufacturing and office space, TEAM Industries is a trusted industry leader in the markets it serves.
To unify their brand and expand their web presence, TEAM turned to MVP to design and implement a new website. The comprehensive website, powered by the MVP-modified TeamMate℠ WordPress platform, features a custom design that extends the TEAM Industries brand and elevates the industry standard.
“I want to express my sincere gratitude to the MVP Marketing + Design team for their outstanding work on our new website. From the very beginning, they were professional, responsive, and always willing to go above and beyond to ensure that our vision was brought to life,” said Tammy Harstad, TEAM Industries’ Marketing and Communications Manager.
Prior to undertaking redesign, MVP conducted needs assessment and marketing research to ensure that TEAM’s new site met the client’s goals and surpassed the competition immediately upon launch.
With TEAM Industries’ objectives clarified, MVP kick-started the project by deploying its proven MVP’s TeamMate℠ process. This design-to-development methodology, based on the waterfall method of software engineering, ensures that client websites look great and function with ease for both company customers and the employees responsible for site upkeep.
TEAM Industries’ new website features the use of robust fonts, imagery, and a custom color palette to impress visitors. These design elements project and reinforce TEAM’s state-of-the-art capabilities and strong build quality. Future plans call for the site to be upgraded to E-Commerce and ERP integration.
TEAM Industries’ new website is a testament to the company’s reputation, which is based on an industry-leading combination of technological innovation, responsiveness, and dependability.
“The final website is nothing short of amazing, and we have already received numerous compliments on the sleek, modern design, and easy navigation of our site,” exclaimed Harstad. “We are truly grateful for all of the hard work and dedication that MVP put into this project.”

“MVP has been our go-to partner for website design for the last five years. After speaking with MVP, it was clear they understood and could execute on our requirements. Our newest and second consecutive MVP website redesign demonstrates their deep knowledge and understanding of private equity industry communications, our business and marketing requirements, and their commitment to a form follows function approach, which is far superior to the many template-based, and quite frankly vulnerable, solutions we saw from other agencies… All in all, I can definitely say that they definitely lived up to their reputation as the ‘PE MVP’.”

“MVP Has been our go-to partner for website design for the last five years. MVP was the first firm we called when we decided to do a complete overhaul of our site.

Our newest and second consecutive MVP website redesign demonstrates their deep knowledge and understanding of private equity industry communications our business and marketing requirements, and their commitment to form follows function approach, which is far superior to the many template-based, and quite frankly vulnerable, solutions we saw from other agencies.”
